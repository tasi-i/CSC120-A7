- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
To me Inheritance was one of the easier lessons we have had. I undertsand how there are different types of buidlings and they all inheratly have similary things while they do not all have the same function. My advice would be to understand Inheritance before you try to code it out.
A error I kept having was:
"tempCodeRunnerFile.java:1: error: reached end of file while parsing
a
^
1 error"
Whenever I code I always click enter to the next line. However this time the error sometimes would show and I realized I need to fix that habit.
